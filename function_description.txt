This function considers an NCUC problem involving thermal_n generating units and thermal_hour time periods. pg and onoff are decision variables in the NCUC problem, their values are unknown and cannot be used directly for calculation. pg is a continuous variable; pg[m][n] represents the power output of unit m during time period n. onoff is a binary variable; onoff[m][n] indicates the operational state of unit m during time period n, where onoff equals 1 signifies the unit is operating, and otherwise, it is shut down. PG_MAX[m] is the maximum power output of unit m. PG_MIN[m] is the minimum power output of unit m. T_MIN_DOWN[m] is the minimum downtime for unit m. T_MIN_UP[m] is the minimum uptime for unit m. RU[m] is the ramp-up rate of unit m. RD[m] is the ramp-down rate of unit m. a[m], b[m], c[m] are coefficients of the cost function for unit m. PG_SUC[m] is the startup cost of unit m. thermal_n represents the number of generating units, and thermal_hour represents the number of time periods. The function heuristics_v1 accepts the decision variables (pg_relax and onoff_relax) from the root relaxation solution of the NCUC problem, as well as the actual decision variables (pg and onoff), and returns a neighborhood constraint to limit the total extent to which onoff deviates from onoff_relax. alpha[m,n] represents the weight of deviation for onoff[m,n] from the relaxed value onoff_relax[m,n], calculated separately based on whether onoff_relax[m,n] is greater than 0.5 or less than 0.5. neighbor_sum is the weighted sum of deviations between onoff and the relaxed values onoff_relax; this weighted sum must be less than r.
