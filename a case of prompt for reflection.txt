Below are two heuristics functions for neighborhood search for NCUC
This function considers an NCUC problem involving thermal_n generating units and thermal_hour time periods. pg and onoff are decision variables in the NCUC problem, their values are unknown and cannot be used directly for calculation. pg is a continuous variable; pg[m][n] represents the power output of unit m during time period n. onoff is a binary variable; onoff[m][n] indicates the operational state of unit m during time period n, where onoff equals 1 signifies the unit is operating, and otherwise, it is shut down. PG_MAX[m] is the maximum power output of unit m. PG_MIN[m] is the minimum power output of unit m. T_MIN_DOWN[m] is the minimum downtime for unit m. T_MIN_UP[m] is the minimum uptime for unit m. RU[m] is the ramp-up rate of unit m. RD[m] is the ramp-down rate of unit m. a[m], b[m], c[m] are coefficients of the cost function for unit m. PG_SUC[m] is the startup cost of unit m. thermal_n represents the number of generating units, and thermal_hour represents the number of time periods. The function heuristics_v1 accepts the decision variables (pg_relax and onoff_relax) from the root relaxation solution of the NCUC problem, as well as the actual decision variables (pg and onoff), and returns a neighborhood constraint to limit the total extent to which onoff deviates from onoff_relax. alpha[m,n] represents the weight of deviation for onoff[m,n] from the relaxed value onoff_relax[m,n], calculated separately based on whether onoff_relax[m,n] is greater than 0.5 or less than 0.5. neighbor_sum is the weighted sum of deviations between onoff and the relaxed values onoff_relax; this weighted sum must be less than r.

You are provided with two codes below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    alpha = np.zeros(pg.shape)
    beta = np.zeros(onoff.shape)
    
    r = 2 * thermal_n * thermal_hour / 10  # Increase the constraint limit to give more flexibility
    
    for m in range(thermal_n):
        for n in range(thermal_hour):
            if onoff_relax[m][n] < 0.5:
                alpha[m][n] = 2 * (0.5 - onoff_relax[m][n])
                beta[m][n] = PG_SUC[m] + T_MIN_DOWN[m] * a[m]
            else:
                alpha[m][n] = 2 * (onoff_relax[m][n] - 0.5)
                beta[m][n] = PG_SUC[m] + T_MIN_UP[m] * a[m]
    
    # Initialize neighbor sum
    neighbor_sum = gurobipy.LinExpr()
    
    for m in range(thermal_n):
        for n in range(thermal_hour):
            # Penalty for changing the state of unit m from OFF to ON
            if onoff_relax[m][n] < 0.5:
                neighbor_sum += alpha[m][n] * onoff[m][n] + beta[m][n] * (onoff[m][n])
            # Penalty for changing the state of unit m from ON to OFF
            else:
                neighbor_sum += alpha[m][n] * (1 - onoff[m][n]) + beta[m][n] * (1 - onoff[m][n])
    
    return neighbor_sum <= r

[Better code]
    alpha = np.zeros(pg.shape)
    r = thermal_n * thermal_hour / 10
    less_than_half = onoff_relax < 0.5
    larger_than_half = onoff_relax >= 0.5
    alpha[less_than_half] = 2*(0.5 - onoff_relax[less_than_half])
    alpha[larger_than_half] = 2*(onoff_relax[larger_than_half] - 0.5)
    neighbor_sum = (alpha[less_than_half] * onoff[less_than_half]).sum() + (alpha[larger_than_half] * (1 - onoff[larger_than_half])).sum()
    return neighbor_sum <= r

You respond with some prompts for designing better heuristics, based on the two codes and using less than 50 words.
